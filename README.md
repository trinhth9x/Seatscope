# Seatscope

**See every seat. Reclaim the wasted ones.**

Seatscope is an open-source dashboard that shows SaaS license **usage, cost, waste, inactive users, and upcoming renewals** across all connected services — so companies can reclaim seats and save money. Read-only: it never changes your accounts.

> Value story: help teams spot unused GitHub / Microsoft 365 / Azure DevOps / etc. seats and reclaim spend quickly with a self-hosted, open-source tool.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 20+** (Node 24 recommended) — only needed for the non-Docker installs, or
- **Docker** (recommended — no Node needed on the host; the image ships Node 24).

Seatscope starts on **mock data** so you can explore the whole UI before adding any
real credentials. Connectors are configured later in the web UI (Connectors page).

## 🚀 Deploy

### 🐳 Docker (recommended)

Using Docker Compose (persists your config in a named volume):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trinhth9x/Seatscope.git
cd Seatscope
docker compose up -d
```

Or with plain Docker:

```bash
docker build -t seatscope .
docker run -d --name seatscope -p 4000:4000 -v seatscope-data:/app/data seatscope
```

Open **http://localhost:4000**. To update: `git pull && docker compose up -d --build`.

### 🐧 Linux

```bash
# Node.js 20+ required, Node 24 recommended (e.g. via nodesource or your distro's package manager)
git clone https://github.com/trinhth9x/Seatscope.git
cd Seatscope
npm ci --omit=dev
npm start          # runs on http://localhost:4000
```

**Run in the background with PM2** (auto-restart + start on boot):

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start server.js --name seatscope
pm2 save && pm2 startup      # follow the printed command to enable on boot
```

Or as a **systemd service** — create `/etc/systemd/system/seatscope.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Seatscope
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/opt/Seatscope
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node server.js
Environment=PORT=4000
Restart=always
User=www-data

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now seatscope
```

### 🪟 Windows

```powershell
# Install Node.js 20+ (Node 24 recommended) from https://nodejs.org first
git clone https://github.com/trinhth9x/Seatscope.git
cd Seatscope
npm ci --omit=dev
npm start          # runs on http://localhost:4000
```

To keep it running in the background / start with Windows, use PM2:

```powershell
npm install -g pm2 pm2-windows-startup
pm2 start server.js --name seatscope
pm2 save
pm2-startup install
```

## Configuration

No configuration is required to start — Seatscope boots on mock data. To connect
real services, open the **Connectors** page in the web UI and add credentials there
(they are stored on your server under `data/`, never committed).

Optional environment variables:

- `PORT` — HTTP port (default `4000`).
- `DATA_SOURCE` — `mock` (default) or `live`. You can also toggle this from the UI.
- `REFRESH_DAILY_HOUR` — local hour (0-23) for the daily auto-refresh (default `0`,
  i.e. midnight). A refresh only re-calls the vendor APIs (no heavy CPU), so daily is cheap.
- `REFRESH_INTERVAL_HOURS` — optional: use a fixed interval instead of the daily run
  (e.g. `168` = weekly). Set to `0` to disable auto-refresh entirely. The **↻ Refresh**
  button in the UI always fetches live data on demand regardless of these settings.

```

- **Connectors** (`src/connectors/*.js`) each implement `async collect()` returning the same raw shape. Add a new vendor without touching the rest.
- **`src/aggregate.js`** holds the central "waste" logic (`STALE_DAYS = 45`; `never` = assigned but never used, `idle` = no activity 45+ days).
- **`server.js`** loads the connector chosen by `DATA_SOURCE`, caches the result, and serves `/api/dashboard`.
- **`public/`** is the professional dashboard (Overview, Wasted licenses, Inactive users, Renewals).

## How waste is calculated

Waste is computed **per assignment** — i.e. per `(user × license/SKU)` pair — in
`src/aggregate.js`:

- Each assignment has a `lastActivity` date supplied by its connector.
- `STALE_DAYS = 45`. An assignment's status is:
  - `never` — assigned but never used (`lastActivity` is null)
  - `idle` — no activity for more than 45 days
  - `active` — used within the last 45 days
- `wastedSoFar = wastedDays × dailyCost`, where `dailyCost = costMonthly × 12 / 365`.
  `wastedDays` = days since last activity (`idle`) or days since it was assigned (`never`).
- Per-user and global totals are just roll-ups (sums) of these per-assignment values.

### What "activity" means per connector

| Connector | `lastActivity` source | Granularity |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **GitHub** | `last_activity_at` from the Copilot billing API | **Per seat** (exact) |
| **Microsoft 365** | The user's last **sign-in** (`signInActivity`, with a raw sign-in-log fallback by `userId`) | **Per user**, applied to all of that user's licenses |

> **Note on Microsoft 365 accuracy:** M365 activity is measured at the **user
> sign-in level**, not per individual service. A single sign-in marks *all* of that
> user's M365 licenses (E5, Intune, Teams, etc.) as active with the same date.
> This means Seatscope can tell you a user is active in the tenant, but **not**
> whether they actually use the specific features a bundled SKU (like E5) grants.
> Truly per-service usage would require the Microsoft 365 **usage reports API**
> (`getOffice365ActiveUserDetail`), which is intentionally not used here to keep
> the tool simple and its required permissions minimal. Always **review before
> reclaiming a license** — the dashboard flags candidates, it does not confirm
> that a seat is safe to remove.

## Live connectors (implemented)

Set `DATA_SOURCE=live`. Every connector with credentials in `.env` runs and is merged.
Add a vendor = one file + one line in `src/connectors/live.js`.

### GitHub Copilot — `src/connectors/github.js` (fastest proof)
The Copilot billing API returns **exact `last_activity_at` per seat**, so unused paid
seats are measured, not guessed.
- `GITHUB_ORG`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` (org owner; classic scopes `read:org`, `manage_billing:copilot`)
- Optional `GITHUB_COPILOT_UNIT_COST` to set your negotiated price/seat.

### Microsoft 365 / Entra — `src/connectors/m365.js`
App-only Microsoft Graph. Flags users holding E5/E3/Power BI/Copilot seats who
haven't signed in for weeks.
- `MS_TENANT_ID`, `MS_CLIENT_ID`, `MS_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Entra app Application permissions (read-only, admin-consented):
  `Organization.Read.All`, `User.Read.All`, `AuditLog.Read.All`
- `signInActivity` (last-used) needs **Entra ID P1** on the tenant.
- Graph has no price API — edit `PRICE_MAP` in `m365.js` with your contract prices.

All connectors return `{ services, skus, people, assignments }`; the "waste" logic
lives once in `src/aggregate.js`.

## Security

Seatscope is **read-only** — it never modifies your accounts. Credentials stay on
your own server: `.env` and everything under `data/` (including `data/connectors.json`,
which holds connector tokens) are git-ignored and are **never** committed.

### Automated scanning

Automated scanning is optional. If you want it later, you can add GitHub Actions,
SonarCloud, or other code/dependency/secret scanning tools that fit your workflow.
